Introduction:
------

OSC (Open Sound Control) is a protocol on top of UDP commonly used by
audio applications. It could be seem as a /MIDI evolution/. 

D3 is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

In this project, I combined OSC with D3. I use mobile APP TouchOSC to transmit data to web browser and use d3 to load the data and do further performance.


Prerequisites:
------

- [[http://nodejs.org][node.js]]
- [[http://socket.io][socket.io]]
- an OSC supported application ([[http://puredata.org][Puredata]]) or hardware controller


Installation:
------

First of all, download and install nodejs from http://nodejs.org, then:

$ git clone git://github.com/wmjpillow/OSC-D3

$ cd osc-web/

$ npm install


Using:
------

Run the bridge app on your machine (localhost):

$ cd osc-web

$ node bridge.js

Launch another Terminal window. An example HTML is avaitable at web-side/app.html. Open it in your browser:

$ cd osc-web

$ cd web-side/

$ open app.html

Now you can run your favorite OSC app/device and send OSC messages
through port 3333. Those messages will be send to the HTML page by
WebSockets.

Configure your favore OSC app/device to listen to OSC messages coming
into port 3334. Any message sent by app.html (hit the button!) will be
sent to your OSC app/device.

So, you can face the HTML page as an "OSC node", listening to messages
on 3333 and sending messages to 3334.
